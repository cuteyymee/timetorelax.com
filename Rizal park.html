<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Rizal Park also known as Luneta Park or simply Luneta, is a historic urban park located in Ermita, Manila, Philippines.</p>
<p> Rizal Park, widely known as Luneta Park is an iconic park that carries with it a rich history, as it is the location where the country's National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal was executed.</p>
<p> Rizal Park is the largest city park in Asia. </p>
<h2> History </h2>
<p> 
Formerly called <q>Luneta</q> from the French word Lunette which means a cresent-shaped fort, it was the site of “La Calzada”, the social hub of Manila’s elite. It was also used by the Spaniards as an execution ground for rebels and activist. Dr. Jose Rizal was executed in Rizal Park on December 30, 1896. </p>
<p> The park remains a flagship of freedom and courage as numerous political rallies, oath takings, and national events are held within the park. When historic events are not taking the limelight, everyday activities keep it alive and bustling: joggers at dawn, afternoon concert, lovers strolling at sunset, family picnics on weekends, and many more. Everyday people come, people go. With their memories and monuments, Rizal Park will be kept alive and going for centuries to come." </p>
