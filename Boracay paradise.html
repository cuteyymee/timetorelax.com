<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Boracay is a resort island in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines.</p>
<p> Boracay is famous for its pristine white beaches, thrilling water activities, and great nightlife experiences. </p>
<p> Boracay is a tropical island surrounded by stunning white sand beaches and clear blue waters located about an hour's flight from Cebu or Manila just off the larger Philippines island of Panay.</p>
<h2> History </h2>
<p> Boracay Island is located off the northwest corner of the island of Panay, and belongs to the Western Visayas island-group, or Region VI, of the Philippines. </p>
<p> <q> Boracay Island was originally home to the Ati tribe. Boracay is part of Aklan Province, which became an independent province on April 25, 1956. Formerly undiscovered, it wasn’t till the 1970s that tourism began to develop in Boracay, and the island became popular with backpackers in the 1980s.</q></p>

<p> Decades ago, Boracay Island was a well-guarded secret, almost possessively so that only a few knew of its existence. </p>
<p> <q>It was only in the 70’s when, it is said, a foreign movie crew accidentally “discovered” this island paradise. Others maintain that it was the German traveller, Jens Peters’ book, which included rave reviews of Boracay that changed the island’s pace from that of being a quiet secret to eventually being voted as having the best beach in the world.</q></p>
<h2> Environment </h2>
<p> With an average year-round temperature of 30°C, and an average humidity of 75%, Boracay Island has a tropical climate that makes it a pleasant place to stay at almost any time.
The best time to visit Boracay is obviously during the high season, when the island is warm and dry.

<p> The best time to visit Boracay is in the sweet-spot months between the busy tourist season and the wet season. December through April: These are the best months to travel to Boracay, when you will have the best weather and the most activity on the island. </p>
