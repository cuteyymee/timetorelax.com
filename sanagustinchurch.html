<p>Beyond being a place of worship, San Agustin Church Manila is a masterpiece that every traveler looks forward to visiting in the city.</p> 
<p>Built in 1595, San Agustin Manila, officially known as Church of the Immaculate Conception of San Agustin, is the oldest church in the Philippines. It exhibits remarkable features such as retablos (altars) of high Baroque style and wall buttresses separating cripto collateral chapels. What makes it unique is its ceiling paintings in the tromp l’oeil style.</p>
<p>The centuries-old church bore witness to the 400 years of Spanish rule in the country. It has survived many bombings and earthquakes, and through its countless renovations, incorporated other influences including Filipino and Chinese designs. Clearly, the church stands witness to the rises and falls of the Philippines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The building of the church started in 1571 under the auspices of the Agustinian Order. Like many structures during that time, the St Augustine Church Manila was built with nipa and bamboo.</p> 
<p>In 1574, the Chinese pirate, Limahong, invaded Manila. The invasion led to the burning of the city, among those burned was the San Agustin Church. This led to the first reconstruction of the church a year later. To rebuild the church, they used wooden materials which are more prone to fire. True enough, another fire caused the church’s destruction in 1583.</p>
<p>To avoid the same mistakes before, the Augustinian friars decided to rebuild the church using adobe stones. In 1586, they appointed Juan Macias to lead the design and construction of the church and was only completed in 1607. The new structure endured even the strongest earthquake that hit Manila from the 16th to 17th century. The only major damage was the collapse of one of the church’s bell towers, which was then permanently removed after.</p>
<p>Because of the church’s age of more than 400 years, it has become a witness to many significant events in Philippine history during the Spanish period. In 1762, during the Seven Years War, British forces looted the church. In 1898, San Agustin Church Manila became a venue for American and Spaniards to discuss and sign the surrender of Manila to the Americans.</p>
<p>During World War II, the Japanese forces turned St Augustine Church Manila into a concentration camp for prisoners. As the Battle of Manila in 1945 drew to a close, the Japanese held hostage priests and hundreds of residents inside the church. To drive out the remaining Japanese, American and Filipino forces conducted an air raid inside Intramuros. Because of that, structures in the walled city were reduced to rubbles but the San Agustin Church Intramuros Manila remained standing; one of the few that were left intact in Intramuros after the war. </p>

<p>The San Agustin Church is patterned after some of the magnificent temples built by the Augustinians in Mexico. The present edifice was built in 1587, and completed, together with the monastery, in 1604. The atmosphere is medieval since <q>both church and monastery symbolize the majesty and equilibrium of a Spanish golden era.</q></p>
<p>The massive structure of the church is highlighted by the symmetry and splendor of the interiors (painted by two Italians who succeeded in producing trompe l'oeil) – the profile of the mouldings, rosettes and sunken panels which appear as three-dimensional carvings, a baroque pulpit with the native pineapple as a motif, the grand pipe organ, the antechoir with a 16th-century crucifix, the choir seats carved in molave with ivory inlays of the 17th century and the set of 16 huge and beautiful chandeliers from Paris.</p>
