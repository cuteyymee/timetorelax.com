<p>Wright Park is a wooded area in Baguio which became known for its horseback riding services for tourists. It was named after American Governor Luke E. Wright and was established as a recreational area. It is situated near The Mansion. The horses are owned and handled by <q>pony boys</q>, who are often a member of the Ibaloi community.</p>
<p>The park was closed down in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has since reopened to local tourists in July 2020. In the same year, an outbreak of equine infectious anemia broke out affecting the health of horses in Wright Park.</p>
<p>In September 2020, the Baguio city government unveiled a â‚±717 million development plan which it conceived prior to the pandemic.</p>
