<p>If you're visiting Bohol, you definitely should not pass up the chance to visit the Loboc River. This clean river is amongst the unfinished Loboc Bridge and the Church of San Pedro or Loboc Church, the second oldest church next to Baclayon. The Loboc Church was originally constructed in 1602 but renovated 35 years later, which resulted in it having two sides: one a Baroque facade (from the Jesuits) and the other a neoclassical porch (by the Recollects).</p>

<p>Loboc River, sometimes called the Loay River, is one of the cleanest rivers in the Philippines. It has seemingly green waters, but some locals stated that its color is from the reflection of leaves, and it has originally brown waters.</p>
<p>The Loboc River (also called Loay River) is a river in the Bohol province of the Philippines. It is one of the major tourist destinations of Bohol.</p>
<p>The source of the Loboc River is located in the town of Carmen, almost in the center of Bohol. From Carmen, the river takes a westerly course for a distance of about 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) then flows due south into the Mindanao or Bohol Sea. Its drainage area of approximately, 520 square kilometres (200 sq mi), is bordered by a horseshoe-shaped chain of mountain peaks rising to an elevation of 800 metres (2,600 ft). Rainfall is distributed almost uniformly throughout the year, thus Loboc River has a steady and high base flow.</p>

<h2>Attractions</h2>

<p>The Loboc river passes through the town center of the Municipality of Loboc, offering a riverside view of the Loboc church across the highway. Various activities on the river, including the river cruise and standup paddleboarding[4] typically feature a scenic trip upriver to Busay falls,[3] or to various points in the river where visitors can enjoy buffets, cultural presentations, firefly watching, birding, and even paddleboard yoga.</p>
<p>Prior to an earthquake that struck Bohol in 2013, night cruises on the Loboc river also featured lightshows through colored lights installed on the river banks. However, the lights were severely damaged due to the said earthquake.</p>

<hr>

<p>Going to Loboc River is easy, especially with the right directions. You can ride a tricycle to the bus terminal from the Tagbilaran airport to travel by bus to Loboc. You can also take jeepneys or multicabs from Tagbilaran City as local transport. But, if you want some air conditioned transportation, vans and taxis are also possible but usually price 50% more.

<h3>River Cruise</h3>
<p>Treat yourself for 60-90 minutes by riding a river cruise and enjoying a buffet at Bohol's famous floating restaurant. Indulge in tasty Filipino cuisine and enjoy the iconic view of the Loboc River. As you cruise along the river from the Loay Bridge or the town's Poblacion, you can follow your stomach's desire and choose among a wide variety of usual Filipino dishes that may be grilled, fried, or more.

<p>You will also get to hear old love songs coming from a band that performs in the raft. Experience the local life as you see locals, such as children jumping from a tree branch to the water, teenage boys swimming on the clear river waters, or adults working by the river. Usually, river cruise boats stop by stations where local people perform Filipino traditional songs and native dances such as tinikling and more, which you can join if you are brave enough to try. The view of Busay Falls will also greet you at the end of the cruise; though not a big waterfall, it is one of the highlights of the trip for taking photos.
