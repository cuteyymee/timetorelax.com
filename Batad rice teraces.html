<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Batad Rice Terraces of Ifugao, Philippines, is declared as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System due to its traditional system characterized with a synergy of goals of biodiversity conservation, sustainable productivity, and strengthening of traditions and culture. </p>
<p> Batad and Bangaan are under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Banaue but are not called the Banaue Rice Terraces. </p>
<h2> History </h2>
<p> The rice terraces here at Batad were originally built 2000 years ago and have stone walls, unlike others in the region that have mud walls. For centuries, farmers have worked these fields, using pretty much the same methods now as they did when they were first constructed. </p>

<p> It’s quite incredible to see the continuity in the farming practices over such a long period. And it’s amazing to think that something their ancestors built so long ago is still paying dividends now. An impressive inheritance for scores of generations. </p.

<p> It is also inscribed as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. However, in spite of the fact that it is considered a living sustainable agricultural system, it is hypothesized that the rice terraces are not immune to the impacts brought about by climate change. </p>
