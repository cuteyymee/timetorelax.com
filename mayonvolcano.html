<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mayon (Central Bikol: Bulkan Mayon; Tagalog: Bulkang Mayon, IPA: [mɐjɔn]), also known as Mount Mayon and Mayon Volcano (Spanish: Monte Mayón, Volcán Mayón), is an active stratovolcano in the province of Albay in Bicol Region, on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. A popular tourist spot, it is renowned for its <q>perfect cone</q> because of its symmetric conical shape, and is regarded as very sacred in Philippine mythology.</p>

<p>The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural Park in 2000. It is the centerpiece of the Albay Biosphere Reserve, declared by <abbr>UNESCO</abbr> in 2016, and is currently being nominated as a World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines, and its activity is regularly monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology <abbr>(PHIVOLCS)</abbr> from their provincial headquarters on Ligñon Hill, about 12 kilometers (7.5 mi) from the summit.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Mayon is the main landmark and highest point of the province of Albay and the whole Bicol Region in the Philippines, rising 2,463 meters (8,081 ft) from the shores of the Albay Gulf about 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) away. The volcano is geographically shared by the eight cities and municipalities of Legazpi, Daraga, Camalig, Guinobatan, Ligao, Tabaco, Malilipot, and Santo Domingo (clockwise from Legazpi), which divide the cone like slices of a pie when viewing a map of their political boundaries.</p>
