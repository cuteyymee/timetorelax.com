<h2>Capturing the sceneric view of Corregidor Island</h2>
<p>Corregidor Island, rocky island, strategically located at the entrance of Manila Bay, just south of Bataan province, Luzon, Philippines. It is a national shrine commemorating the battle fought there by U.S. and Filipino forces against overwhelming numbers of Japanese during World War II.</p>
<p>The thick clouds failed to stop the scenic views from giving us a warm welcome the moment we arrived at Corregidor Island. The view here rocks even in a low-light condition. Everyone was very excited to hop on the tourist bus not just because of eagerness to explore its beauty, but because of the sudden rain shower as well. I’m sure that I’m not the only one who got frustrated because of the weather but good thing the clouds went away after a few minutes</p>

<p>Corregidor Island is rich with scenic views and panoramic landscapes. This small island will surely delight nature lovers with its lush green trees, captivating coastlines and stunning horizon view.</p>
<h2>Sight Seeing on the Island</h2>
<p>There are different ways that you can enjoy sight-seeing in this island despite its steepness. It’s great that most of its parts have cemented roads. We’ve seen some fellas using ATVs (All-Terrain-Vehicle – P500.00/pax for 1 hour) to roam around and some who do it the classic way, on foot. I’m not sure if you can bring your own bicycle, skateboard, motorcycle, etc. there if you plan to go overnight. I haven’t seen a rental for those in their list either.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The small (2-square-mile [5-square-km]) island, part of the province of Cavite, has long been considered a natural fortress. The Spanish fortified it in the 18th century, when it was used as a registration (corregidor) site for ships entering the bay. After the Spanish-American War, the island became a U.S. military station, and an elaborate system of tunnels and emplacements was constructed. When Japan invaded the Philippines (December 1941), Gen. Douglas MacArthur chose Bataan and Corregidor Island as his major defense positions. Bataan fell on April 9, 1942, and Corregidor Island became the last outpost of organized resistance in the islands. Lieut. Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright and his forces repelled the invaders for 27 days, until May 6, 1942, when they were forced to surrender Corregidor Island to Lieut. Gen. Homma Masaharu. U.S. forces regained the island in 1945.</p>
