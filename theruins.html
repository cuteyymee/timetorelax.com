<p>The Ruins Mansion is the remains of an ancestral home built in 1920 by a wealthy sugar baron named Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson. Don Mariano constructed the mansion as a testament of his love for his Portuguese wife, Cora Maria Osorio Rosa -Braga, after she passed away in 1911. Maria, who was pregnant with their eleventh child at the time, lost her and their baby's lives after figuring in an accident.</p>
<p>Don Mariano built the structure in a 440-hectare sugar plantation situated in the border of present-day Talisay and Bacolod. It's architecture was described as Italianate due to deriving inspiration from Italian Architecture. However, it was later set aflame in 1942 by Filipino guerilla fighters employed by the United States Armed Forces during the Second World War.</p>
<p>This was done in order to prevent its use as a military office by the Invading Japanese Forces. It continously burned for three days until its current cement frame was left standing. The original intention was to burn it to the ground. Despite losing the majority of the mansion, its ruins have been recognized as one of the architectural wonders of the Philippines. It has also gained title such as <q>Taj Majal of the Philippines.</q></p>
<p>Today, the Ruins Mansion is in the private ownership of the great-grandchildren of Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson and Cora Maria Osorio Rosa-Braga.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ruins (Talisay) was the ancestral mansion of the family of wealthy sugar baron Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson built on a 440 hectare sugar plantation in Talisay City, Negros Occidental in the early 1900s in memory of his Portuguese wife Maria Braga Lacson, who died during the birth of their eleventh child. During World War 2, Filipino guerillas burned it down as a countermeasure to prevent the invading Japanese forces from using it as a military office. It burned for 3 straight days.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>It is built in Italianate architecture. The ruins is an example of brilliant architecture. Located on a sugar plantation in the Negros Occidental province of the Philippines, WWII Filipino guerrillas employed by the US Armed forces intentionally set the building on fire in order to prevent invading Japanese forces from being able to use the building as a headquarters. The intention was to burn it to the ground.</p>
